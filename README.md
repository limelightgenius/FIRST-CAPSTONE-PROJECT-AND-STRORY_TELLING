CAPSTONE PROJECT AND STORYTELLING  WALK-THROUGH
Problem Statement
The business had access to a large sales dataset containing order, product, customer, and geographic information. However, the raw data was messy, inconsistent, and not analysis-ready, making it difficult for decision-makers to understand sales performance, revenue trends, and key growth drivers.
The objective of this project was to clean, analyze, and transform the raw sales data into clear, reliable insights, and present those insights through an interactive dashboard that stakeholders could use to make informed business decisions.

Project Objectives
•	Clean and standardize raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency
•	Analyze sales performance across time, product lines, deal sizes, and regions
•	Identify key revenue drivers and performance trends
•	Build a professional dashboard that communicates insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

Methodology & WorkflowS
1. Data Cleaning (Python, Excel, SQL)
The project began with extensive data cleaning using Python (Pandas), supported by Excel and SQL where appropriate.
Key cleaning steps included:
•	Handling missing values in critical numerical and date fields
•	Removing duplicate transactions to prevent inflated revenue figures
•	Fixing incorrect data types (dates, quantities, prices)
•	Standardizing text fields (status, country, product line)
•	Correcting inconsistent categorical values
•	Handling outliers in quantity and pricing data
•	Filtering out cancelled and invalid orders
•	Creating new calculated fields such as Revenue, Year, Month, and Quarter
•	Renaming and removing irrelevant columns for clarity
This process transformed the raw dataset into a clean, reliable, analysis-ready dataset.

2. Analytical Exploration (SQL + Excel Integration)
Once the data was cleaned, SQL was used to extract and aggregate key business metrics, including:
•	Total and yearly revenue
•	Monthly revenue trends
•	Revenue by product line
•	Revenue by deal size
•	Revenue by order status
•	Revenue by country
The SQL outputs were then imported into Excel for:
•	Pivot table analysis
•	Trend identification
•	Cross-checking and validating metrics
•	Initial visual exploration
This step ensured both accuracy and analytical depth, combining SQL’s precision with Excel’s flexibility.

3. Visualization & Storytelling (Power BI)
In the final stage, the cleaned and analyzed data was loaded into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.
The dashboard included:
•	KPI cards (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value)
•	Revenue trends over time (line charts)
•	Product line performance (bar charts)
•	Revenue by country and region
•	Deal size contribution to total revenue
•	Interactive slicers for time period, product line, country, and deal size
The dashboard was designed to be executive-friendly, enabling users to explore insights quickly without technical knowledge.

Key Insights Discovered
	YEARLY SALES : THERE IS A GOOD START IN 2003 FOLLOWING  A GREAT PEAK/ PERFORMANCE  IN 2004 WITH HUGE DIP IN 2005. MORE MARKETING/ DISCOUNT MIGHT HELP BOOST SALES AGAIN.

	PRODUCT SALES :  CLASSIC CALES MADE THE MOST SALES, CREATING AHUGE GAP BETWEEN OTHE PRODUCT SALES, MIGHT BE DUE TO AESTHETIC, MORE MARKETING ON CLASSIC CARS AND MAYBE A NEW LOCATION OR DEALS WITH OTHER CARS.


	DEAL SIZE: MEDIUM DEAL SIZE TOOK A WHOPPING 5O% OF THE TOTAL REVENUE 

	SHIPPING_STATUS: MOST PRODUCT ARE SHIPPED, INDICATING EFEFCTIVE PROCESSES.


	COUNTRY SALES: MOST SALES WERE MADE FROM  USA INDICATRING HUGE PRODUCT DEMAND MORE MARKETIING AND DEALS COULD HELP BOOST SALES MORE.. 

Business Value
•	Provided leadership with a single source of truth for sales performance
•	Enabled faster, data-driven decision-making through interactive reporting
•	Highlighted key revenue drivers and underperforming segments
•	Demonstrated an end-to-end analytics workflow: data cleaning → analysis → visualization → insight




 Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python (Pandas) – Data cleaning, transformation, feature creation
•	SQL – Aggregation and structured analysis
•	Excel – Pivot tables, validation, exploratory analysis
•	Power BI – Interactive dashboard and data storytelling

Conclusion
AS AN ASPIRING ANALYST. This project demonstrates a complete, real-world data analytics workflow. By transforming raw, messy data into actionable insights and an interactive dashboard, the project showcases strong technical skills, analytical thinking, and the ability to communicate data-driven insights effectively to business stakeholders. Equipping me to lock in what I have learnt so far.
